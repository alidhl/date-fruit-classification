# Date Fruit Classifier

This project applies machine learning to classify date fruit types into nine different classes. It utilizes TensorFlow to construct neural networks with convolutional layers for image recognition and classification. Additionally, it leverages OpenAI's ChatGPT to generate unique facts about each date fruit type, providing users with engaging and informative content. The web interface is built using Streamlit, offering an interactive and user-friendly experience.
